# N-queens-problem-solver-
The N-Queens problem asks:

“How can you place N queens on an N × N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other?”

Queens can attack along:

1. the same row,

2. the same column, or

3. diagonals.

So, the goal is to find all possible safe placements.
This program:

1. Takes an integer n (default = 8),

2. Finds all ways to place n queens on an n×n board safely,

3. Prints each valid arrangement and the total number of solutions.
